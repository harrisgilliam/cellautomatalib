	Change LUT, CMAP to allocate from the UNIX heap initially and
then allocate device driver space only when needed.  Would have to
allocate whenever the IFC or KER address is requested.  This allows
the LUT and CMAP data types to be used w/o CAM8.  Would be difficult
to extend this to STEPLIST or INBUF.  Probably can extend this to
BUFFER.  This would also allow the caching of look up tables,
colormaps and buffers (typically pattern data) on the UNIX heap.  When
no more device driver memory is available one or more BUFFERs, LUTs or
CMAPs can be cached by allocating UNIX heap, copying the contents and
deallocating the device driver memory.  This provides a speed memory
tradeoff.

	Need to intergrate the EQV and ECLASS data types into CAMlib.
The code for eqv2lut (the lexer and supporting procedures) will also
be rolled into the library.
