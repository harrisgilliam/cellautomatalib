Cam8Experiment


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8Instr

	Has all the code needed to make CAM8 register instructions.
All values and frobnication of the instruction data handled by this
code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8Steplist

	Has all the code needed to implement new steplist methodology.
Cam8Steplist will eventually be a subclass of an instruction stream
class which is a general abstraction for a sequence of instructions
sent to a cellular automata machine for execution.  This is where we
start to leave the CAM8 specific world and move into the CA library
general world.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8

	Main class for users who are writing programs that only run on
CAM8.  Need methods that parallel ForthSTEP CAM assembly words.  Based
on c8cpp code but need to check implementation because c8cpp has bugs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8Core

	This is an abstract class: prototype methods for memory
management, reading/writing register set, initializing and error
detection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8HardwareCore

	Subclass of Cam8Core.  Interface to real hardware.  Interact
with device driver.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8SimCore

	Subclass of Cam8Core.  Interact with C interpreter version of
cam8sim code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8SimSPARCCore

	Subclass of Cam8Core.  Interact with Just-In-Time compiler
version of cam8sim code for SPARC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cam8SimPICore

	Subclass of Cam8Core.  Interact with external cam8sim process
via pipe interface.
