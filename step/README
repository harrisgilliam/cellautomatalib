This is the first release of the STEP control software.  The other
major components of the software are the device driver, the XCAM
interface (X-window acting as a CAM monitor), and the CAM8 simulator.
The XCAM program in particular provides a rich set of graphical
services (eg, saving images to postscript files, saving movies, etc),
and it uses TCL, XV, and other programs.  Both the XCAM program and
the cam8 simulator are documented elsewhere -- they won't be discussed
further here, except at the level of how to turn them on and off.

The STEP system is built on top of Mitch Bradley's "Sun Forth".  The
STEP-specific extensions are essentially all contained in this
directory.  There is a Makefile setup to "make" the STEP program.
Type: make step

The STEP program also uses a number of C procedures for access to the
operating system.  They are linked into the Forth system using clink.
These are split by category in the files:

link-Cdefines.c		# Routines to return the value of C #defines
link-driver.c		# Interface to the CAM8 device driver
link-file.c		# UNIX file system calls
link-fork.c		# UNIX process creation system calls
link-math.c		# UNIX math library using integers
link-mem.c		# UNIX memory mapping system calls
link-shm.c		# UNIX shared memory system calls
link-pipe.c		# UNIX pipe creation/usage system calls
link-misc.c		# Misc UNIX system calls

Here is a list of what "loadstep.fth" loads, with some comments.
These files will be updated and reorganized in the next release of the
software.

In addition, this directory contains the following other files:

README			# This file
f.base			# Used by clink
f.out			# Used by clink
forth*			# Forth executable
forth.exe		# Forth dictionary
step*			# script to start the STEP program
todo.list		# revisions that are planned soon


For further information, look at the comments in the source files in
this directory, and the glossary which contains many of the functions
used in them.  You can also look at the README file in the
".../cam8/demos" directory, and at the documentation for XCAM and for
the CAM-8 simulator.  A technical reference manual describing CAM-8 at
the hardware level may also be helpful; an overview of the CAM-8
functionality and operation is contained in the paper, "CAM-8: a
computer architecture based on cellular automata."
