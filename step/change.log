5/18/97:  all "step" files are now un-tabified
        
          save-active-subcell and restore-active-subcell should completely
          ignore the higher-level information about which subcell bits are
          active that are maintained by the higher-level software.  To do
          this, they should be sure not to touch this higher-level info.
          In particular, any "step" or "*step*" that they do should let
          fields persist.
        
          Check other uses of "step" and "*step*" for this bug.
          Convention: I/O words act on active subcell, unless an I/O
          subcell was specified.  At the end of each I/O operation, the
          active subcell is changed back to zero.  The I/O subcell
          persists.
